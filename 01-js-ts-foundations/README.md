# JavaScript & TypeScript Foundations Exercises

Welcome to the JavaScript & TypeScript Foundations Exercises! This repository contains a series of coding challenges designed to help you practice fundamental concepts in both JavaScript and TypeScript, ranging from easy to hard difficulty.

## Getting Started

1.  **Navigate to the module directory:**

    ```bash
    cd 02-js-ts-foundations
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run Tests:**

    To run all tests and see which problems are solved:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

    You can also run tests for a specific file (e.g., `variables-let.test.js`):

    ```bash
    npm test variables-let.test.js
    ```

## The Challenge

Your task is to implement the functions in the `topics/` directory. Each file in `topics/` contains a function signature and a description of what needs to be implemented. Once you've implemented a function, run its corresponding test file in `tests/` to verify your solution.

## Problems (Easy to Hard)

### Easy

These problems cover basic syntax, variable declarations, and fundamental data types.

*   **`variables-let.js`**: Understand and demonstrate the block scope of `let`.
*   **`variables-const.js`**: Understand and demonstrate the immutability of `const`.
*   **`console.js`**: Use `console.log` to output messages.
*   **`data-types-string.js`**: Manipulate and concatenate strings.
*   **`data-types-number.js`**: Perform basic arithmetic operations with numbers.
*   **`data-types-boolean.js`**: Work with boolean values and logical comparisons.
*   **`array.js`**: Perform basic array operations like adding elements.
*   **`object.js`**: Work with objects, including adding new properties.
*   **`functions.js`**: Define and call basic functions.
*   **`arrow-functions.js`**: Implement functions using arrow function syntax.
*   **`conditions.js`**: Use conditional statements (`if/else`) for decision making.
*   **`basic-types.ts`**: (TypeScript) Declare variables with basic types (string, number, boolean).
*   **`array-types.ts`**: (TypeScript) Declare and work with typed arrays.
*   **`enums.ts`**: (TypeScript) Define and use enums for a set of named constants.

### Medium

These problems introduce more complex JavaScript concepts.

*   **`higher-order-functions.js`**: Implement functions using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
*   **`this-keyword.js`**: Understand and correctly use the `this` keyword in different contexts.

### Hard

These problems delve into advanced JavaScript and TypeScript patterns.

*   **`promises.js`**: Work with Promises for asynchronous operations.
*   **`async-await.js`**: Work with `async`/`await` for asynchronous operations.
